l# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- Seeing everybody on campus is fun
- I've been able to stay up to date with my workload very efficently, being able to finish all homework during the week, working out, and generally maintaining a good work life balance.
- 
## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- My professor told me I uoghta drop the class after the second day cause he thought I didn't know enough. (I'm not dropping the class).
