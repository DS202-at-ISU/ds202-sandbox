l# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- seeing everybody on campus is fun
- I found a nice hat on the ground

## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- Calculus III is hard. Professors and TA's are great though
