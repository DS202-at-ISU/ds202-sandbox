We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- I'm excited to learn all about Data Science this semester

- seeing everybody on campus is fun

## Crappies

- Last week I slipped on ice on my way home from class

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
