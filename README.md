  l# Ode to an awesome advisor
We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- seeing everybody on campus is fun
- I've been consistently lifting again since school started

## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- I spilled a bottle of olive oil all over the kitchen
