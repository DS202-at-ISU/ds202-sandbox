We are trying to write this together as a group


## Happies

- playing minecraft
-  I got to play broomball last weekend and catch up with the guys
-  Made some new friends
- Winning the Cyhawk game


## Crappies

- Digging out a car from the snow in the parking lot at 10 Fahrenheit is hard
- driving through a blizzard
- I turned in an assignment 15 min late and got a 0 for it
- Got a sucky lab TA that ignores people (including the other TA)
- Not being able to go to the Cyhawk game in person
